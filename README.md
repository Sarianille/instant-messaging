## Instant messaging
Very brief explanation:
The project uses boost/asio. You can install it through vcpkg. Here is a link to the tutorial: https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html
First, you need to get the server running in one terminal. You need to specify the port as a command line argument.
Then, you can join as a user in a different terminal (or several of them, just open more terminals). You need to specify the IPv4 address and the server's port as command line arguments.
Once you've joined, you can send messages and chat.
